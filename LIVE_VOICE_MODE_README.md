## What is Live Voice Mode?

Live Voice Mode transforms Browser.AI into a natural, hands-free conversational AI assistant. Just speak naturally, pause, and the AI responds automatically - no clicking required!

### Key Features
- ✅ **Hands-free**: Click "Go Live" once, then just talk
- ✅ **Auto-send**: Messages send automatically after you pause
- ✅ **Continuous**: AI speaks, then starts listening again
- ✅ **Interruptible**: Start speaking to interrupt the AI
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: See exactly what's happening

---

## Quick Start

1. **Click** "Go Live" button (red button in header)
2. **Speak** your message naturally
3. **Pause** for 1.5 seconds when done
4. **Listen** to AI response
5. **Continue** - it automatically starts listening again!

**That's it!** No more clicking buttons during conversation.

## Common Questions

Click the "Go Live" button in the conversation header.

### How does it know when I'm done speaking?
It waits for 1.5 seconds of silence before sending your message.

Yes! Just start speaking and it will stop and listen to you.

### Do I need to click anything after "Go Live"?
Nope! Just speak and pause. Everything else is automatic.

### How do I exit Live Mode?
Click the "Exit Live Mode" button or toggle "Go Live" off.

### Why isn't it working?
Make sure you're using regular Chrome (not CDP mode) and have granted microphone permissions.

## Troubleshooting

### "Voice input not supported"

**Solution**: Use regular Chrome (not via CDP endpoint)

### Auto-send not working
**Problem**: Speaking without pauses  
**Solution**: Pause for 1.5 seconds after completing your thought

### Can't interrupt AI
**Problem**: Microphone not detecting voice  
**Solution**: Check mic permissions and volume levels
