# Intelligent Website Selection - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive intelligent website selection system that allows the Browser.AI agent to dynamically research, select, and try multiple websites for shopping, downloading, and other tasks instead of relying on hardcoded website preferences.

## Files Modified

### 1. `browser_ai/controller/views.py`
**Changes**:
- Updated `SearchEcommerceAction` model documentation to include more sites
- Added new `FindBestWebsiteAction` model with fields:
  - `purpose`: String describing what the user wants to do
  - `category`: Categorization ("shopping", "download", "information", "service", "other")

**Purpose**: Define the data models for new intelligent website selection actions.

### 2. `browser_ai/controller/service.py`
**Changes**:
- Imported `FindBestWebsiteAction` in the imports section
- Added new `find_best_website` action:
  - Constructs intelligent Google search queries based on purpose and category
  - Searches for "best website to [purpose]"
  - Returns research results for agent to review and select from
- Enhanced `search_ecommerce` action:
  - Added support for international sites: Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, Alibaba
  - Improved URL construction for different e-commerce platforms
  - Added fallback logic for unknown sites
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing Sri Lankan sites (Daraz, Ikman, Glomark)

**Purpose**: Implement the core functionality for intelligent website research and multi-site e-commerce support.

### 3. `browser_ai/agent/prompts.py`
**Changes**:
- Added Section 6: "INTELLIGENT WEBSITE SELECTION" with detailed guidance:
  - Instructions to always use `find_best_website` first for shopping/downloads
  - Step-by-step workflow for multi-site search strategy
  - Guidance on handling "not found" scenarios
  - Memory tracking requirements for site attempts
- Added Section 7: "MULTI-SITE SEARCH STRATEGY":
  - Instructions for maintaining alternative website lists
  - Documentation requirements for each site attempt
  - Guidance on trying 2-3 alternatives before giving up
  - Tips for using different search terms on different sites
- Renumbered subsequent sections (8-11) to maintain proper ordering

**Purpose**: Guide the LLM to use the new capabilities intelligently and implement multi-site fallback strategies.

### 4. `examples/intelligent_shopping.py`
**Changes**:
- Updated documentation to emphasize multi-site capabilities
- Enhanced Example 1: Added multi-site shopping strategy
- Enhanced Example 2: Demonstrates automatic fallback to alternative sites
- Enhanced Example 3: Shows intelligent download source research
- Added Example 4: Cross-site price comparison use case

**Purpose**: Provide clear, working examples of the new intelligent website selection features.

**Purpose**: Verify that all changes work correctly and provide a testing framework.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Website Research
- `find_best_website` action that uses Google to research appropriate websites
- Supports multiple categories: shopping, download, information, service
- Returns curated search results for agent to analyze

### 2. Expanded E-commerce Support
- International platforms: Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, Alibaba
- Regional platforms: Daraz, Ikman, Glomark (Sri Lanka)
- Generic fallback for unknown e-commerce sites
- Proper URL construction for each platform's search syntax

### 3. Multi-Site Fallback Strategy
- Agent automatically tries 2-3 alternative websites if first one fails
- Memory tracking of which sites have been tried
- Documentation of why each site failed
- Persistence until item found or alternatives exhausted

### 4. Intelligent Prompting
- LLM is guided to research before navigating
- Clear workflow: research → try first site → if failed, try next → repeat
- Memory tracking requirements ensure agent doesn't forget what it tried
- Emphasis on not giving up after one failed attempt

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**:
- Old code using `search_ecommerce` without site parameter still works
- Defaults to Daraz.lk for Sri Lankan context (existing behavior)
- All existing actions remain unchanged
- New actions are additive, not replacing existing ones

## Testing Strategy

Three levels of testing:
1. **Model Tests**: Verify Pydantic models are correctly defined
2. **Registration Tests**: Ensure actions are registered in controller
3. **Execution Tests**: Test actual browser automation with new actions

Run tests with:
```bash
python test_intelligent_website_selection.py
```

## Usage Pattern

### Before (Hardcoded)
```python
task = "Search for laptops on Daraz"
agent = Agent(task=task, llm=llm)
```

### After (Intelligent)
```python
task = "Find the best site to buy laptops and show me gaming laptops under $1000"
agent = Agent(task=task, llm=llm)
# Agent will:
# 1. Research best laptop shopping sites
# 2. Try top site (e.g., Amazon)
# 3. If not satisfied, try next site (e.g., Newegg)
# 4. Continue until good results found
```

## Benefits

1. **Higher Success Rate**: Multi-site fallback increases chance of finding items
2. **Better Prices**: Comparing across sites often finds better deals
3. **More Flexibility**: Works with any website, not just predefined ones
4. **Smarter Agent**: Researches and makes informed decisions
5. **User-Friendly**: Users don't need to know which sites to use

## Performance Impact

- **Initial Research**: +1 step (Google search) at start of task
- **Multi-Site Attempts**: Each additional site is a separate navigation
- **Token Usage**: Slightly higher due to memory tracking, but worth it for success rate
- **Overall**: Small overhead, significant improvement in capability

## Example Workflows

### Shopping Workflow
1. Task: "Buy wireless earbuds under $50"
2. Agent calls `find_best_website(purpose="buy wireless earbuds", category="shopping")`
3. Reviews results, identifies: Amazon, eBay, Best Buy
4. Tries Amazon first with `search_ecommerce(query="wireless earbuds under $50", site="amazon.com")`
5. If no good matches, tries eBay
6. Continues until finds suitable options

### Download Workflow
1. Task: "Download Python tutorial PDF"
2. Agent calls `find_best_website(purpose="download python tutorial", category="download")`
3. Identifies reputable sites: Python.org, Real Python, Tutorial Point
4. Navigates to most appropriate site
5. Searches and downloads PDF

### Multi-Site Search Workflow
1. Task: "Find vintage camera under $200"
2. Researches best marketplaces for vintage electronics
3. Creates list: eBay, Etsy, Reverb
4. Tries eBay → not found → Memory: "eBay: no results under $200"
5. Tries Etsy → found! → Completes task

## Error Handling

- **CAPTCHA**: Uses existing `request_user_help` mechanism
- **Site Down**: Notes failure, tries next site
- **No Results**: Documents in memory, tries alternative with different search terms
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects existing retry logic

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

1. Cache successful site selections for common product categories
2. Learn from past successful/failed site selections
3. Integrate price comparison APIs
4. Regional preference configuration
5. Parallel site checking for faster results
