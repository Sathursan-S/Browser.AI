## 🔄 How It Works

### Location Detection Flow
```
Shopping Task Starts
        ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  detect_location()      │ ← NEW ACTION
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
            ↓
Navigate to ipapi.co/json/
Extract: {"country_code": "LK"}
            ↓
Lookup in LOCATION_DATABASE
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📍 Sri Lanka (LK)                   │
│ 💰 LKR (Rs)                         │
│ 🛒 daraz.lk, ikman.lk, glomark.lk   │
└───────────┬─────────────────────────┘
            │
            ↓
All subsequent shopping uses this context
```

### Fast Results Flow
```
OLD (SLOW):
Search → 1 product → Scroll → 2 → Scroll → 3 → DONE (5 min)

NEW (FAST):
Search → 1-2 products visible → IMMEDIATELY DONE (30 sec)

Key: Don't wait for exactly 3, return ANY results found
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adding a New Country

**File:** `browser_ai/location_service.py`

```python
LOCATION_DATABASE = {
    # Add your country here:
    "XX": LocationInfo(
        country="Country Name",
        country_code="XX",  # ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
        region=Region.ASIA,  # Or EUROPE, NORTH_AMERICA, etc.
        currency="XXX",  # ISO 4217
        currency_symbol="$",
        language="en",  # ISO 639-1
        timezone="Asia/City",  # IANA timezone
        preferred_ecommerce_sites=[
            "site1.country",
            "site2.country",
            "site3.country"
        ]
    ),
}
```

### Adding a New E-commerce Site

**File:** `browser_ai/controller/service.py` → `search_ecommerce()`

```python
elif 'yoursite.com' in site or site == 'yoursite':
    search_url = f'https://www.yoursite.com/search?q={search_query}'
```

### Adjusting Fast Results Behavior

**File:** `browser_ai/agent/prompts.py` → Section 8

**Current:**
```
- Return results IMMEDIATELY when you find ANY products (1, 2, or 3+)
```

**Make Even Faster:**
```
- Return results IMMEDIATELY when you find the FIRST product
```

**Make More Thorough:**
```
- Return results when you find AT LEAST 2 products
- Scroll up to TWICE to gather more options
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Location detection slow
**Cause:** Network latency to ipapi.co  
**Solution:** Detection only happens once per session, cached after

### Issue: IP location wrong (VPN/proxy)
**Cause:** IP geolocation is imprecise  
**Solution:** Manual override: `detector.set_location_manual("XX")`

### Issue: Some countries not supported
**Cause:** Limited LOCATION_DATABASE  
**Solution:** Easy to add! Just edit location_service.py

### Issue: Regional site URL wrong
**Cause:** Site pattern not recognized
