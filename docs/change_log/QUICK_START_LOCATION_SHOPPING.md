## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### When Location Detection Helps Most

✅ **Shopping for products with local variants**
- Electronics (voltage, plug types differ)
- Clothing (sizing systems differ)
- Food items (availability differs)

✅ **Price-sensitive purchases**
- Knowing exact local currency matters
- Comparing with local alternatives
- Understanding shipping costs

✅ **Regional product availability**
- Some brands only sell in certain countries
- Local marketplaces (Daraz, Lazada, etc.)
- Regional Amazon sites (.com, .in, .co.uk, etc.)

❌ **When it doesn't matter**
- Digital products (same globally)
- Searching for information (not buying)
- Company-specific websites

### When Fast Results Work Best

✅ **Common products** (many results available)
- Popular items
- Standard electronics
- Books, music, videos

✅ **Time-sensitive searches**
- Quick price checks
- Urgent purchases
- Comparison shopping

✅ **Limited availability items**
- Vintage/rare items
- Out of stock products
- Regional exclusives

❌ **When you actually need exactly 3**
- Detailed comparison tasks
- Research assignments
- Comprehensive market surveys

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Default Site for a Country

**File:** `browser_ai/location_service.py`

```python
# Find your country in LOCATION_DATABASE
"LK": LocationInfo(
    country="Sri Lanka",
    # ... other fields ...
    preferred_ecommerce_sites=[
        "daraz.lk",      # 1st choice (default)
        "ikman.lk",      # 2nd choice
        "glomark.lk",    # 3rd choice
        "kapruka.com"    # 4th choice
    ]
)

# To change default, just reorder the list:
preferred_ecommerce_sites=[
    "ikman.lk",      # Now 1st choice!
    "daraz.lk",
    "glomark.lk"
]
```

### Add Your Country

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Using USD for everyone"
**Cause:** Location detection failed  
**Fix:**
1. Check backend logs for "Location detected"
2. Ensure ipapi.co is accessible
3. Try VPN if IP location is wrong
4. Restart backend server

### Issue: "Still searching for exactly 3 products"
**Cause:** Old prompts cached or not updated  
**Fix:**
1. Restart backend server
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check prompts.py for new Section 8
4. Verify no syntax errors in prompts

### Issue: "Wrong country detected"
**Cause:** IP geolocation is imprecise  
**Fix:**
```python
# In your code, manually set location:
from browser_ai.location_service import LocationDetector

detector = LocationDetector()
detector.set_location_manual("LK")  # Force Sri Lanka
```

### Issue: "Regional site not working"
**Cause:** Site URL pattern not recognized  
**Fix:** Update `search_ecommerce` in controller/service.py:
```python
elif 'yoursite.com' in site:
    search_url = f'https://yoursite.com/search?q={search_query}'
```
